# ChatRoom
This is a chat room created using Socket programming and Python. A system can run the server script to create a server and others can join the server using the client script. One can see the server logs while the server script is running. The main challenges faced and overcome are the concepts of threading and concurrency. <b>The main issue that still prevails is the exit part. Still working on it though.</b> One can change the <code>server_ip</code> and <code>server_port</code> values to allow users on the LAN to join your server.
